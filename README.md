# HTTPS.code_

A personal collection of programming examples and experimental code written across multiple languages.

This repository contains standalone programs, scripts, and notebooks created for learning, practice, and exploration of core programming concepts. While the repository name suggests HTTPS or networking, the current contents are broader and focus on foundational coding exercises and small utilities.
